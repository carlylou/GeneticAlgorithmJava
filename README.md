# GeneticAlgorithmJava
Genetic Algorithm to optimize the arrangement of orderings.

This project is about application of GA.



# How to RUN:
In terminal run this:

$ javac GA.java                             
$ java GA numberOfGeneration (like: java GA 100, You can also choose not to provide arguments value, the default value is 500.)

This java program will generate a graph showing the final result of GA and a text file to show you the value of progress from every generation .
# Details about theory and implementaion of GA:
